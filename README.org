* redmine.el

~redmine.el~ is a simple package to interact with the redmine restful
webservice easily. Essentially it abstracts most API calls to the
Redmine API.

** Usage

To access the Redmine API you have to specifiy the redmine to access
and the API key to access it with. ThatÂ´s either done via setting the
variables ~redmine/host~ and ~redmine/api-key~

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq redmine/host "https://www.my-redmine.org")
(setq redmine/api-key "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890")
#+END_SRC

or bind the variables ~redmine-host~ and ~redmine-api-key~
dynamically.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (let ((redmine-host "https://www.my-redmine.org")
        (redmine-api-key "acdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"))
    (redmine/get-issues))
#+END_SRC
